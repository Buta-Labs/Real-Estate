# ADDENDUM - OWNER-STAY TIER PROPERTIES
## Utility + Investment Hybrid

This addendum applies specifically to **Owner-Stay Tier (Tier 2)** properties and should be read in conjunction with the base Offering Memorandum.

## 1. FAIR USAGE RIGHTS POLICY

### 1.1 Calculation Formula
Your annual usage rights are calculated dynamically based on your ownership percentage:

```
Annual Stay Days = Floor((Your Tokens / Total Tokens) × 365)
```

**Example:**
- Total Property Valuation: $500,000
- Your Investment: $25,000 (5% ownership)
- Annual Stay Days: Floor(0.05 × 365) = **18 days per year**

### 1.2 Minimum Threshold
To unlock usage rights, you must hold at least **$5,000** worth of tokens (or 1% ownership, whichever is higher).

**Below Threshold:** You retain economic rights (share of sale proceeds) but cannot book stays.

---

## 2. USAGE RIGHTS MECHANICS

### 2.1 Annual Reset
Usage rights **reset on January 1st** each year and do **not** roll over.

**Example:**
- 2025 Allocation: 18 days
- You use: 10 days
- Unused: 8 days (forfeited on Dec 31, 2025)
- 2026 Allocation: 18 days (fresh allocation)

### 2.2 Booking Process
- Access the "Book Dates" feature in the mobile app
- Subject to availability (first-come, first-served among token holders)
- Blackout dates may apply (holidays, peak seasons)
- Minimum booking: 2 nights
- Maximum consecutive booking: 14 nights

### 2.3 Booking Priority
Priority is determined by:
1. Ownership percentage (higher % = earlier booking window)
2. Token holder seniority (earlier investors get priority)

---

## 3. TRANSFER OF USAGE RIGHTS

### 3.1 Token Sale Impact
**Critical Disclosure:** If you sell your tokens on the secondary market, your usage rights **immediately transfer** to the new buyer.

**Example:**
- You own 5% (18 days/year)
- You sell all tokens in June
- You lose access to remaining days in that year
- New buyer gains those rights

### 3.2 Partial Sale
If you sell only a portion of your tokens:
- Your usage days are recalculated based on remaining ownership
- The buyer gains usage rights proportional to their purchase

**Example:**
- Original: 5% ownership = 18 days
- You sell 2.5% (half your tokens)
- Your new allocation: 9 days
- Buyer's allocation: 9 days

### 3.3 Buyer Threshold Requirement
The new buyer must meet the $5,000 minimum threshold to activate usage rights. If they purchase less than the threshold, they receive economic rights only.

## 4. OWNER-STAY TIER SPECIFIC RISKS

### 4.1 Availability Risk
**No Guarantee of Availability:** Even with usage rights, you may not be able to book your preferred dates if:
- Other token holders book first
- Property is under maintenance
- Blackout dates apply

### 4.2 Property Condition Risk
Orre MMC maintains the property to rental standards, but:
- Wear and tear may occur between your stays
- Furnishings may change
- Amenities may be temporarily unavailable

### 4.3 Usage Rights Termination
Your usage rights **end immediately** upon:
- Final property sale
- Selling all your tokens
- Falling below the minimum threshold

---

## 5. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE

### 5.1 No Rental Income
Owner-Stay properties do **not** generate rental income for token holders. The property is reserved exclusively for token holder usage.

### 5.2 Operating Expense Coverage
Operating expenses (HOA, taxes, insurance, maintenance) are covered by:
- A small usage fee charged per night (typically $50-100/night)
- Orre MMC's management fee allocation

### 5.3 Return on Investment
Your return comes from:
- **Utility Value:** Free/discounted stays (vs. hotel costs)
- **Capital Appreciation:** Final sale proceeds

**Example ROI Calculation:**
- Investment: $25,000
- Annual Stay Days: 18
- Equivalent Hotel Cost: $150/night × 18 = $2,700/year
- 5-Year Utility Value: $13,500
- Final Sale Proceeds (assuming 20% appreciation): $30,000
- Total Return: $18,500 (74% over 5 years)

---

## 6. EXIT STRATEGY FOR OWNER-STAY TIER

- **Warning:** You will lose all future usage rights
- Pricing should account for both economic value and utility value
- Demand may be limited to buyers seeking usage rights

### 6.2 Secondary Exit: Final Property Sale
