# ADDENDUM - RENTAL TIER PROPERTIES
## Income-Focused Investment

This addendum applies specifically to **Rental Tier (Tier 0)** properties and should be read in conjunction with the base Offering Memorandum.

## 1. DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION POLICY

### 1.1 Calculation Method
Net Distributable Income (NDI) is calculated monthly as follows:

```
Gross Rent Collected
- Operating Expenses (HOA, Property Tax, Insurance, Repairs)
- Management Fee (10% of Gross Rent)
= Net Distributable Income
```

### 1.2 Distribution Schedule
Dividends are declared and deposited to the smart contract at the Manager's discretion, typically:
- **Monthly:** For stabilized properties with consistent rental income
- **Quarterly:** For properties with seasonal variations or development phase

### 1.3 Pro-Rata Distribution
Dividends are distributed proportionally based on token ownership at the time of declaration.

**Example:**
- Total Tokens: 10,000
- Your Tokens: 500 (5% ownership)
- Monthly NDI: $2,000
- Your Dividend: $100

## 2. RENTAL TIER SPECIFIC RISKS

### 2.1 Vacancy Risk
**Critical Disclosure:** If the property has no tenant, **no dividends will be paid**. Operating expenses (HOA, taxes, insurance) must still be covered, which may result in:
- Zero dividend periods
- Potential capital calls (rare, but possible)
- Reduced annual yield

### 2.2 Tenant Default Risk
If a tenant fails to pay rent:
- Legal eviction processes may take 30-90 days
- Lost rent is not recoverable
- Dividends will be reduced or suspended during this period

### 2.3 Maintenance Risk
Unexpected repairs (HVAC failure, plumbing issues, roof damage) are deducted from gross rent before dividend distribution, potentially reducing or eliminating dividends in that period.

---

## 3. OPERATING EXPENSE COVERAGE

### 3.1 Reserve Fund
Orre MMC maintains a reserve fund equal to 3-6 months of operating expenses to cover:
- Vacancy periods
- Emergency repairs
- Tenant turnover costs

### 3.2 Expense Pass-Through
All operating expenses are passed through to investors via dividend reductions. Orre MMC does not subsidize operating costs.

## 4. EXIT STRATEGY FOR RENTAL TIER

### 4.1 Primary Exit: Secondary Market (P2P)
Rental tier investors typically hold for long-term income. If you need liquidity:
- List your tokens on the Orre MMC secondary marketplace
- Pricing is determined by market demand
- Transactions settle within 24-48 hours upon buyer acceptance

### 4.2 Secondary Exit: Final Asset Sale
Orre MMC may elect to sell the property after 7-10 years. Upon sale:
- All tokens are redeemed at the final sale price (minus fees)
- Investors receive their pro-rata share of proceeds
- Tokens are burned
