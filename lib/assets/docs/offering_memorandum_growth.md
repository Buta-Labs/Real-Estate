## Capital Appreciation Investment

This addendum applies specifically to **Growth Tier (Tier 1)** properties and should be read in conjunction with the base Offering Memorandum.

## 1. MANDATORY LIQUIDITY EVENT

### 1.1 Exit Timeline
Orre MMC intends to sell the underlying property between **Month 60 and Month 84** (5-7 years) from the date of initial token offering.

**Target Exit Window:**
- Minimum Hold: 5 years
- Maximum Hold: 7 years
- Target Sale Year: [Dynamically shown in app, e.g., 2030]

### 1.2 Sale Process
Upon reaching the target exit window:
1. Orre MMC engages professional real estate brokers
2. Property is marketed to institutional and individual buyers
3. Sale is executed at the best available market price
4. Proceeds are distributed to token holders (minus performance fee)
5. Tokens are permanently burned

### 1.3 Investor Control
**Important:** Investors do **not** vote on the timing or terms of the sale. Orre MMC retains full discretion to optimize exit timing based on market conditions.

## 2. NO DIVIDEND EXPECTATION

### 2.1 Income Policy
Growth Tier properties **do not distribute dividends**. Any rental income generated during the hold period is:
- Reinvested into property improvements
- Used to cover operating expenses
- Accumulated to maximize final sale value

### 2.2 Total Return Focus
Your return comes entirely from capital appreciation at the time of sale:

```
Total Return = (Final Sale Price - Initial Investment) - Performance Fee
```

**Example:**
- Initial Investment: $10,000
- Final Sale Price (your share): $16,000
- Gross Profit: $6,000
- Performance Fee (20%): $1,200
- Net Profit: $4,800
- Total Return: 48% over 6 years (6.8% annualized)

## 3. GROWTH TIER SPECIFIC RISKS

### 3.1 Development/Market Risk
**Critical Disclosure:** If the Baku real estate market declines or development plans are delayed:
- The final sale price may be **lower** than the initial valuation
- You may receive less than your original investment
- There is no guaranteed minimum return

### 3.2 Illiquidity Risk
Growth Tier investments are highly illiquid:
- No dividends for 5-7 years
- Secondary market demand may be limited (buyers prefer income-generating assets)
- You must be prepared to hold until the final sale

### 3.3 Timing Risk
Orre MMC may delay the sale beyond 7 years if market conditions are unfavorable. While rare, this could extend your hold period to 8-10 years.

---

## 4. PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY

### 4.1 Value-Add Initiatives
Orre MMC may implement:
- Interior renovations (modern finishes, smart home tech)
- Amenity upgrades (gym, co-working spaces)
- Energy efficiency improvements (solar panels, insulation)

### 4.2 Reinvestment of Rental Income
Any rental income during the hold period is reinvested into these improvements to maximize final sale value.

---

## 5. EXIT STRATEGY FOR GROWTH TIER

### 5.1 Primary Exit: Final Asset Sale
The **only** meaningful exit is the final property sale. At that time:
- All token holders are redeemed simultaneously
- Proceeds are distributed within 30 days of sale closing
- Tokens are burned and cease to exist

### 5.2 Secondary Exit: P2P (Limited)
You may attempt to sell tokens on the secondary market before the final sale, but:
- Demand is typically low (no dividends to attract buyers)
- You may need to sell at a discount
- Pricing is based on estimated future appreciation
